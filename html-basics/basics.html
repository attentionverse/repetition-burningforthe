                                    Chapter 1: Introduction of the basic html

Html is stands for Hyper Text markup language  used for creating the web pages. Web browser read these html files and display them correctly.
Its consist of several components, series of tags and the browser renders it using these properties of the html. 


What is a Tags in the html?
HTML syntax is fairly simple; it all revolves around tags. A tag is used to identify data and it can be described by using this format:

=> <tag></tag>
We use these < > brackets to enclosed the tag in it, And we need to enclosed it like this </tag> 
We can use uppercase like this: TAG  or lowercase like this: tag because HTML is not a case-sensitive.

So our First Tag in the html is "<!DOCTYPE>"
<!DOCTYPE HTML> : This tag is used to represent the HTML document to the web brwoser and display it as web page.
<html></html> : This tag is used to represent  HTML document and it will be started from this <html> and enclosed with this </html> in the end of the web page . 
<head> </head>: This tag is used to represent the heading of the webpage it will be started from this <head> and ends with this </head> .
<title> </title>: This tag is used to represent the tittle  of the webpage it will be started from this <title> and ends with this </title> .
<body></body>: This tag is used to represent the body of the webpage it will be started from this <body> and ends with this </body> .
<p></p>: This tag is used to type paragraph in the webpage it will be started from this <p> and ends with this </p> .

With this Example of the tags and basic representation of the html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
</html>

This is the basic template of the html and we use it to  display a basic webpage, In the upcoming chapter we can learn about different types of  tags
and its elements and attributes. 

                                      Chapter: 2 Elements in the html

"HTML-elements": It is the another part of the basic of the Html which is very important for the structure of the html. 
The element is like this: <tag>content</tag> this how we described an element in html for example: <p>Hello world!</p> . 
It will show Hello world! as output in the web page. 

In html we use Nested element because html contains other element. 
Html follows a pre-defined structure in which all the elements are kept inside it.
 
1.<html>:  It is the main element for the html and all the element are kept inside this element as follows.

2.<head>: It contains the header and title element.

3.<title>: It defines the title of the webpage.


4.<body>: It contains all the element that help to display the webpage.

There are several rules for defining the elements in the html: 
1. It should be start with this <> and ends with </> . 
2. It should always be lowercase for i.e: <p>, <br>...etc 
3. It should always be closed when we decelared it. for i.e: <p> </p>, <a></a>, <div></div>..etc 

With this Example of the element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the element example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello<br> world!</p>
    </body>
</html>

Here we use <p> element and <br> element  inside the body tag or we can say body element.

                                    Chapter 3: Attributes in the HTML

Now we know what is an Element in the html but we don't know how can we modified that element in the html for this problem we need 
a solution which is known as an Attributes in Html.

Attributes is like properties of the element or we can say it provides more information about the elements.
There are some rules for calling the attributes inside an element:

1. It always be specified/written inside the starting tag of the elements.
for i.e: <p style="font-size: 100px;">Hello World!</p>. 
In the above example "style" is the attributes for the <p> element which modified the "Hello World!" and increase the font-size of the "Hello World!". 

2. It always comes with the predefined name and its predefined vlaues like above in the example.
There are several pre-defined names for the attributes for i.e: 'style', 'class', 'id', 'href', 'src'...etc which we discussed later in the chapters. 

3. Always quotes the Attributes.

4. It should be written in lowercase.

Lets take an example of <a> element where we use 'href' as attributes and discussed its functionality: 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is the example of the anchor tag where we use 'href'as attributes</p>
        <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/html-tutorial/html.php">Click me</a>
    </body>
    </html>
    In the above example we use an <a> element and use {href} as attribute, the {href} attributes will create a hyper text link. When we click on it it will redirect us to the new web page.
    And that is how our basic html work.

Lets take another example where we use <img> as an element and <src> as an attribute :
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/05/18/35/aircraft-1499171__340.jpg">
    </body>
    </html>    
    So here we use <img> as element and <src> as attribute because we declare <img> tag for the image in the html however for this we need a source file also.
        For that we need this {src} attribute so we can put our url/location in it.
        
        There are 2 type of Url/location in {src} attributes: 
        1. Absolute Url: It is a Url in which we use external link from the another website/Internet. 
        for example: "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/05/18/35/aircraft-1499171__340.jpg
                          
        2. Relative Url: In this we use local storage or store image within the website. 
        For example:C:\Users\Shekhar\repos\repetition-burningforthe\html-basics. 


                                      Chapter 4: Headings in the HTML

      Till now we have discussed about many topics of the html like its basic templates, tags, elements, attribute, now I am discussng about a Headings in Html. 
      "Heading": As per the name, we can say it as title or subtitle of any element in the HTML.
       1. Heading tag should be specified as <h1></h1>. 
       2. There are 6 types of the heading according there importance <h1> to <h6>. 
       3. <h1> heading tag is the very important.
       4. <h6> heading tag is the very least important.
       5. With the help of heading the search engine will index the structure and content of the web page.
    
       With this example we can see how heading tag is used in the HTML: 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is the important heading tag</h1>
        <h2>This is the less important than h1 heading tag</h2>
        <h3>This is the less important than h2 heading tag</h3>
        <h4>This is the less important than h3 heading tag</h4>
        <h5>This is the less important than h4 heading tag</h5>
        <h6>This is the least important than every heading tag</h6>
    </body>
    </html>
    In this example we use heading tag and mentioned the importance in the heading tag.Just like any other element we can add attributes in it like "style", etc.
    Here is the another example wher we can modified the heading tag:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1><a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/html-tutorial/html.php">This is the important heading tag which is clickable.</a></h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 200%;">This is the less important than h1 heading tag</h2>
        <h3 style="color: blue;font-size: 200%;">This is the less important than h2 heading tag</h3>
    </body>
    </html>   
In this example we use different attributes inside the heading tag like "style, href," etc. to modified the heading tag.

                                     Chapter 5: Paragraph in Html 
    So  we learn about different topics in this basics of html, Now we are talking about the the important topic of the html and we call it as 
    Paragraph tag earlier we are using the <p> tag in our example and we don't explain it now I can define what a <p> is used for and its functionality in the Html.
    1. Whenever we need to type any text inside the  body tag we use <p> tag.
    2. It always start from the new line and gives a margin between two <p> tag.
    3. As Html page is rendered in different screen for example pc,mobile phone screen, laptop screen. So we are not sure how it will be displayed for that reason 
      we use <p> tag.
    4. <p> tag has a property that if you we give a margin or we left a space between the text inside a <p> tag  it does'nt show the gap/space between the that text in the webpage.
    5. There are 2 type of separator used in the <p> tag:
        a. <br> tag : This tag is known as line break, and it is used when a line break is required but we do not want to start a new paragraph.                                      
        b. <hr> tag : In an html page, it is known as a thematic break and is used to separate the content.
    Here are the example of <p> element:
        
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1> This is paragraph in html</h1>
            <p> This is the paragraph tag example.</p>
        </body>
        </html>  

 It is the basic paragraph element example.
 now we are creating the example of both <br> tag and <hr> tag:
 
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
    <title>Document</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <p>Hello World <br> this is caused by the break tag</p>
    <hr>
    <p> this is done with the hr tag</p>
 </body>
 </html>  
 
 with the help of this example now we can use the br and hr tag inside the <p> tag.


                                             Chapter 6: Style in Html 
   As above in the chapters we have discussed about the attribute where we use one attribute which is <style> for an element in the html. 
   There are so many properties of style in html like : color,font-size,background-color,etc.
   To modified the element/Tag we use this <tagname style = 'property'> syntax.
   we can modified our element/Tag using two method:
   a. inside the the element/tag starting part.
   b. use <style> tag and call the class name inside the <style> tag.

 With the help of the example I can explain the <style> attributes in html. 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p style='font-size: 150%;background-color:coral'><b>Hello world</b></p>
        
    </body>
    </html> 
    In this example we use style inside the <p> element/Tag. 
    
    Now in this example I am using the <style> tag to style a <p> element.
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>
        <style>
            .edit{
                background-color:rgb(221, 217, 3);
                color: blueviolet;
            }
    
        </style>   
        <body>
            <p class="edit">This is edited by calling the class attribute inside style tag</p>
        </body>
        </html> 
        In this example I use the attribute <class> in the <style> element and then I called the property of the {class "edit"}. 
             
                                            Chapter: 7 Formating in Html 
HTML formatting is the process of styling our content to make it more informative and appealing by using various HTML formatting tags.
There are several tags for formatting the text in html. 
<b>:  Bold text
<strong>:  Important text
<i>:  Italic text
<em>:  Emphasized text
<mark>:  Marked text
<small>: Smaller text
<del>:  Deleted text
<ins>:  Inserted text
<sub>:  Subscript text
<sup>:  Superscript text

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p> This is not an example of bold text <p>
    <p> <b>This is the example of bold text</b> </p>
</body>
</html>
In this we bold the format of the text using <b> tag and it should have a closed tag like this </b>.

<strong> tag in html: 

The HTML strong> element denotes text that is of high importance. The content is usually displayed in bold.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
<body>

<p>This text is normal.</p>

<p><strong>This is a strong tag example</strong></p>

</body>
</html>

The <strong> tag  is used for important text and it should be closed with the </strong>. And it is shown as bold in nature but it is not a bold text.

<i> tag in html: 
The HTML <i> element specifies a section of text in a different voice or mood. The content is usually displayed in italics.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>
    <body>
    
    <p>This text is not an italic </p>
    
    <p><i>This text is italic.</i></p>
    
    </body>
    </html>

    In this example I used a <i></i> tag for formatting the text. 

Now I am using all the tags in this example in all so that you can saw the difference of the formatting in html. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p><b>This is an example of bold.</b></p>
    <p><i>This is an example of  italic.</i></p>
    <p><em>This is an example of  emphasized.</em></p>
    <p>This is an example of normal text.</p>
    <p><small>This is an example of smaller text.</small></p>
    <p>This is an example of <mark> mark text</mark></p>
    <p>This is an example of <del>delte text</del></p>
    <p>This is an example of <del>delted text</del> and  <ins> inserted text in a document</ins>. </p>
    <p>This is an example of <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
    <p>This is an example of <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
</body>
</html>
