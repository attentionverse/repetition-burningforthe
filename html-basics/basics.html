Introduction of the basic html. 
Html is stands for Hyper Text markup language  used for creating the web pages. Web browser read these html files and display them correctly.
Its consist of several components, series of tags and the browser renders it using these properties of the html. 


What is a Tags in the html?
HTML syntax is fairly simple; it all revolves around tags. A tag is used to identify data and it can be described by using this format:

=> <tag></tag>
We use these < > brackets to enclosed the tag in it, And we need to enclosed it like this </tag> 
We can use uppercase like this: TAG  or lowercase like this: tag because HTML is not a case-sensitive.

So our First Tag in the html is "<!DOCTYPE>"
<!DOCTYPE HTML> : This tag is used to represent the HTML document to the web brwoser and display it as web page.
<html></html> : This tag is used to represent  HTML document and it will be started from this <html> and enclosed with this </html> in the end of the web page . 
<head> </head>: This tag is used to represent the heading of the webpage it will be started from this <head> and ends with this </head> .
<title> </title>: This tag is used to represent the tittle  of the webpage it will be started from this <title> and ends with this </title> .
<body></body>: This tag is used to represent the body of the webpage it will be started from this <body> and ends with this </body> .
<p></p>: This tag is used to type paragraph in the webpage it will be started from this <p> and ends with this </p> .

With this Example of the tags and basic representation of the html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
</body>
</html>

This is the basic template of the html and we use it to  display a basic webpage, In the upcoming chapter we can learn about different types of  tags
and its elements and attributes. 

Topic - 2:

"HTML-elements": It is the another part of the basic of the Html which is very important for the structure of the html. 
The element is like this: <tag>content</tag> this how we described an element in html for example: <p>Hello world!</p> . 
It will show Hello world! as output in the web page. 

In html we use Nested element because html contains other element. 
Html follows a pre-defined structure in which all the elements are kept inside it.
 
1.<html>:  It is the main element for the html and all the element are kept inside this element as follows.

2.<head>: It contains the header and title element.

3.<title>: It defines the title of the webpage.


4.<body>: It contains all the element that help to display the webpage.

There are several rules for defining the elements in the html: 
1. It should be start with this <> and ends with </> . 
2. It should always be lowercase for i.e: <p>, <br>...etc 
3. It should always be closed when we decelared it. for i.e: <p> </p>, <a></a>, <div></div>..etc 

With this Example of the element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the element example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello<br> world!</p>
    </body>
</html>

Here we use <p> element and <br> element  inside the body tag or we can say body element.
